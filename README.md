# webpack-steps

Each folder represents an application with a progressively more complex webpack configuration.  
I used the `yarn` package manager, with `npm` everything is the same.

Step | Description
-|-
[01 Basic configuration](steps/01/README.md) | Default settings, simple config
[02 Typescript project](steps/02/README.md) | Typescript loader and webpack config in typescript
[03 Live reloading](steps/03/README.md) | DevServer configuration and source maps

# webpack-steps

Each folder represents an application with a progressively more complex webpack configuration.  
I used the `yarn` package manager, but with `npm` the same is done.

Step | Description
-|-
[01 Basic configuration](steps/01/README.md) | Default settings, simple config
[02 Typescript loader](steps/02/README.md) | Typescript loader and webpack config in typescript

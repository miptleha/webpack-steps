## Javascript project

If the application is written entirely in JavaScript without using TypeScript, then the `babel-loader` should be used instead of the `ts-loader`.  
The remaining settings can be left unchanged.  
The webpack configuration file has `.js` extension instead of `.ts`.

Run sample React JavaScript application:
```
npm install
npm start
```

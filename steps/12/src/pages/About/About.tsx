            I’m a former high school teacher turned entrepreneur who loves few things more than a good hug 
            (my love language is Physical Touch, so I’m aaaaall for a tight squeeze), 
            hopping on a flight to anywhere, and teaching people like you how to live an abundant and limitless life.
